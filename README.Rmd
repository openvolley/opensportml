## Installation

``` r
## install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("openvolley/opensportml")
```

The `opensportml` package provides image and video machine learning tools for sports analytics. Many of its functions are re-exported from the [openvolley/ovml](https://github.com/openvolley/ovml) and [openvolley/ovideo](https://github.com/openvolley/ovideo) packages, which provide similar functionality but specifically for volleyball.

Currently two versions of the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) object detection algorithm are included. These have been implemented on top of the [torch](https://torch.mlverse.org/) R package, meaning that no Python installation is required on your system.

## Example

Use a YOLOv4 network to recognize objects in an image. We use an example image bundled with the package:

```{r ex1}
library(opensportml)
img <- os_example_image()
ovml_ggplot(img)
```

Construct the network. The first time this function is run, it will download and cache the network weights file (~250MB).

```{r ex2}
dn <- ovml_yolo()
```

Now we can use the network to detect objects in our image:

```{r ex3}
dets <- ovml_yolo_detect(dn, img)
ovml_ggplot(img, dets)

```

We can transform the image detections to real-world court coordinates. First we need to define the court reference points needed for the transformation. We can use the `os_shiny_court_ref` helper app for this:

```{r ex5h, echo = FALSE}
ref <- list(video_width = 1024,
            video_height = 768,
            court_ref = dplyr::tribble(~image_x, ~image_y, ~court_x, ~court_y,
                                       0.0256, 0.386, 12.5, 46,
                                       0.283, 0.117, 100, 0,
                                       0.867, 0.475, 87.5, 154,
                                       0.582, 0.626, 0, 200))

```

```{r ex5, eval = FALSE}
ref <- os_shiny_court_ref(img)

```

![](man/figures/courtref.png)

`ref` should look something like:

```{r ex6}
ref

```

Now use it with the `ov_transform_points` function (note that currently this function expects the image coordinates to be normalized with respect to the image width and height):

```{r ex7}
court_xy <- ov_transform_points(x = (dets$xmin + dets$xmax)/2/ref$video_width, y = dets$ymin/ref$video_height,
                                ref = ref$court_ref, direction = "to_court")
dets <- cbind(dets, court_xy)

```

And plot it:

```{r ex8}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dets, aes(x, y)) + os_ggcourt() + geom_point()

```

Keep in mind that `ov_transform_points` is using the middle-bottom of each bounding box and transforming it assuming that this represents a point on the court surface (the floor). Locations associated with truncated object boxes, or objects not on the court surface (a tennis racket in a player's hand, players jumping, people in elevated positions such as the referee's stand) will appear further away from the camera than they actually are.
